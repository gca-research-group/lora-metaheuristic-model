# Optimizing Antenna Coverage for Smart and Sustainable Cities
This project aims to optimize the placement of a set of antennas within a geographic area defined by a polygon (e.g., a map of a region), with the goal of maximizing coverage and minimizing the associated costs of antenna placement. The Simulated Annealing algorithm is used to efficiently find the best solution.

# Requirements
This code is implemented in Octave, so you need to have this tool installed to run the code properly. The code also uses several Octave libraries, such as:

* optim
* geometry
* control
* io
* image
